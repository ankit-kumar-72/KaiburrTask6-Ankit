Text Classification for Consumer Complaints

This project aims to perform text classification on a consumer complaint dataset into the following categories:

    0: Credit reporting, repair, or other
    1: Debt collection
    2: Consumer Loan
    3: Mortgage

The dataset used for this project can be found here.
Steps to Follow
1. Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

    Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
    Identify relevant features and perform any necessary data transformations or feature engineering.

2. Text Pre-Processing

    Pre-process the text data to prepare it for modeling.
    Steps may include lowercasing, removing special characters, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.

3. Selection of Multi Classification Model

    Choose a suitable multi-class classification model for the task. Some options include:
        Logistic Regression
        Support Vector Machines
        Random Forest

4. Comparison of Model Performance

    Train and evaluate different models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, etc.).
    Consider techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.

5. Model Evaluation

    Evaluate the chosen model on a holdout dataset or using cross-validation.
    Analyze performance metrics and make any necessary adjustments.

6. Prediction

    Use the trained model to make predictions on new consumer complaints.
